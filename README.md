# serch
search engine router control hub

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/da421a76-2a83-455e-8540-4179fe0a644c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/luka-serch/deploys)

This is a tiny little web tool that reroutes a search to a different search engine based on the search contents.
The use case that compelled me to make this was simply getting really obsessed with Perplexity.com, and wanting it as my default search engine, but wanting *some* searches to be shot over to a regular search engine (since Perplexity takes a longer amount of time to give me search results).

You can use this tool at https://serch.online, where it is directly deployed from this repository via Netlify. Alternatively you can fork this repository and deploy it yourself via Netlify.

Additionally, if you want to make Serch your default Search Engine so that any search in your browser URL bar is routed, you can find instructions at this Perplexity article:
