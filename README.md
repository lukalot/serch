search engine router control hub

This is a tiny little web tool that reroutes a search to a different search engine based on the search contents.
The use case that compelled me to make this was simply getting really obsessed with Perplexity.com, and wanting it as my default search engine, but wanting *some* searches to be shot over to a regular search engine (since Perplexity takes a longer amount of time to give me search results).
